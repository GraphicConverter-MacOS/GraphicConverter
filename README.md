## What is GraphicConverter?

GraphicConverter is a versatile macOS application that blends image viewing, editing, and format conversion into a single, efficient tool. It is built to handle hundreds of file formats, from common JPEG and PNG to obscure or legacy formats, so users can open, inspect, and convert images that other apps might not support. The app suits photographers, designers, archivists, and anyone who needs a reliable way to prepare images for web, print, or archival storage.

The program offers pixel-level editing and a broad set of enhancement tools: color correction, exposure and tone adjustments, sharpening, noise reduction, and perspective fixes. For large jobs, batch processing automates repetitive tasks such as resizing, renaming, metadata editing, and format changes. GraphicConverter also includes precise color management with ICC profile support, enabling predictable results across different devices and output targets.

Beyond editing, GraphicConverter provides useful production features: contact sheets, slideshows, cataloging and browsing modes, and robust metadata handling for EXIF and IPTC tags. Power users can script workflows and create custom presets to speed up routine operations. The interface balances depth and accessibility, offering both quick fixes for casual users and deep controls for professionals, all while remaining optimized for modern macOS and Apple Silicon performance.

Key capabilities include:
- Opening and converting hundreds of image formats.  
- Advanced batch processing for bulk edits and exports.  
- Detailed color management and metadata support.  
- Retouching tools, filters, and geometry corrections.  
- Slideshow, contact sheet, and gallery export features.  
- Scriptable actions and presets for repeatable workflows.  

GraphicConverter is an all-in-one imaging workhorse that reduces the need to switch between multiple apps during photo processing and delivery.
